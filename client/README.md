# First of all we need three initial python script to treat the test better than javascript 

since python is powerfull in term of built-in libraries such as mathematic and files , I choosed to use a better performent script
and to be honest , I am newbie about python so I give it a chance to get ready scripts

## Now we need an express server to get those python script and inject them to my node js server

thanks to child_process of node js which help developer get another language scripts and it is good for me to show that I am familiar with event driven as described in the opportunity .

- npm install 
- npm run nodemon for nodemon server

### it is time for react !!!!

I am using the native library because I don't need a default rounting (3 components in single page ) either a server-side-rendering . So Gatsby and Next are not what needed in my use-case

- npm install 
- npm start for running the react app 

### Finally : final words always have their charm
